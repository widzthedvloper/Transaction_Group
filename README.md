# Transaction Group
An app for grouping transactions by goals. A simple authentication form is used to create a user and log in. The app allows you to create a transaction, create a group and then add the transaction to multiple groups. Design idea by [Gregoire Vella on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/19759151/Snapscan-iOs-design-and-branding)
